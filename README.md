# CS360-Weight-Tracking-App

This app was designed to be a simple way for users to keep track of their weight on an ongoing basis. This application includes a log in page to ensure that all your data is safe. Within the app the user can do things such as set their goal weight, set their SMS permission to allow the app to tell them when they have hit their goal weight, and log as many weights as they want. I coded this app by first finding out how it should flow through the screens and then coding it as the user would see it as they click through. I had many changes in my UI designs throughout my coding to ensure that it is user friendly. I ensured that all features were working as I went along by testing them each time, I would add functionality. During this process I found myself doing a lot of debugging, but it became better as I would discover more things within android studio. Many of the challenges I overcame were regarding the functionality. I had many unexpected outputs and a handful of application force crashes. I believe I was particularly successful in coding the main functionality of the app to handle any user input that could be had given the features I coded in.
